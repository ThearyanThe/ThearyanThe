# About Me

I am a former Front-End Developer with some Back-End experience, now transitioning into the field of **Cybersecurity**.

My background in web development helps me understand how applications are built, how data flows, and where security weaknesses can appear.  
Today, I am focused on learning ethical hacking, defensive security, and real-world attack techniques.

## Background

- Front-End Developer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Basic Back-End experience (Node.js / Express)
- Familiar with API design, authentication, and databases
- Worked on UI templates, dashboards, and small full-stack projects

## Current Focus

I am actively learning:

- Ethical Hacking Fundamentals  
- Linux & Terminal  
- Networking basics  
- Web Application Security  
- OWASP Top 10  
- Vulnerability scanning and exploitation  
- Bug hunting basics  

## Why Cybersecurity?

After working in development, I became interested in how attackers exploit systems and how security flaws are created.  
I want to understand weaknesses from both the **developer** and **attacker** perspectives to build and secure better applications.

## Tools & Technologies

- Linux / Kali Linux  
- Burp Suite  
- Nmap  
- Wireshark  
- Python basics  
- Git & GitHub  

## Goals

- Become a skilled Ethical Hacker  
- Build a strong foundation in Web Security  
- Work on CTFs and practical labs  
- Create security-focused projects and writeups
